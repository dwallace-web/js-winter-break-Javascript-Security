#Javascript Security

##Intro
##Overview of security concepts
###Common Threats
XXS - CROSS SITE scripting -
csrf - request forgery
sensitive data exposure
injection attacks
obfuscation (wearing a disguise)

###Available Resources
OWASP Foundation
Snyk - identify issues and dependences (more than basic npm audiet)
Retire.js - scan app for known issues and security holes in the code
AppSensor - monitor application for live intrusions

##Security Applied XSS
https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/
What happens - pushing code into a form
Evaluate data on the server and client side.

Running function that returns code with innerHTML in React is bad. Don't do it. Why?
Answer: code could be pushed into the inter HTML and screw the app.

Never put unstrusted data in the code or on the site.
Sanitize data before returning the unsafe data and displaying it on the page.
Use element.textContent to populate DOM with safe usage
Frames like react/angular have escaping functions built in like dangerouslySetInnerHTML
Many rules for escaping data.

##Secutity Applied CSRF

1. evaluate headers and assigned token; validate token and request
2. use JWT/JSON token with tools like Auth0 jwt.io

Three Items in the payload: 1) header, 2) payload, 3) signature

Signature proves the requester is who they say they are.
Token used to eval user data request.

_Autho0_ Authentification in web/mobile apps.

Auth0 is an organisation, who manages Universal Identity Platform for web, mobile and IoT can handle any of them â€” B2C, B2B, B2E, or a combination.

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site, to another site, without having to expose their credentials.

##Security Applied Sensitive Data

Define lifecycles for keys and change often.
Authorization needs to be used. Crptography discussion.
Only store needed data.
Data = Cryptography (no exceptions)

"when you build an application, you leverage a library that provides you with the cryptography tools to encrypt your data while it moves across the internet from your server to your client. So if a hacker catches this data midstream, it is unreadable, and without the key or passphrase, impossible to decipher."

**Cryptography Libraries**
Recommended Libraries:
Crypto module with the nodejs library. Node.js.org/API/cryp
Stanford Javacsript Crypto Library SJCL - easy to use and fast - hbitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/ & http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/

##Security Applied SSJI
Injections to force server loops or SQL injectsions.
Used for DDOS attacks

Data validation should be used in SQL. Without it, the data could be forced to return a password. 'Type checking' needed.

Prevention of server injection
Do not use eval setTimeout setInterval or function()
Validate use input before processing with typechcking and other mechanism
When using JSON input use .parse() instead of eval()
Use strict mode at the top of JS files.

Rules for SQL/NoSQ:
Prepared statements instead of dynamic queries with string concatenation
Never provide admin right to the database with the application
Valid use input before processing

##Security Applied Obsfuscation
Hiding code behind algorithm & makes code unreadable;
Scramble code with obfuscator.io; javascript2img scrambler https://javascript2img.com/; jsscrambler.com;

Useful because the client side code gets hidden because the client side code is always visble. Reduces possibility of errors getting exploited.
Unauthorized users should be not able to edit or modify the client side code.
Scrambling reduces possible hacks.
